# meteor-hallojs
A meteor package with the hallo.js rich text editor

#STILL IN DEVELOPMENT
Please wait until this text is removed, right now this library is just a stub while I'm working on it!

#What it does for you?
It includes the editor and the requirements of the editor so you can initialize an editor instance in your client code.

#What is hallo.js

* Simple and minimalistic
* No toolbars, you edit in place
* Easily extendable with commands
* Ex: Mark a word - menu opens - click bold
* Exports to markdown-formatting
* Free MIT licensed
* Editor code on GitHub for you to fork
